# 🗂️ File Organizer

A simple Rust CLI tool to organize files in a directory by their file type.

## ✨ Features

- Organizes files into folders based on their extensions (e.g., `.jpg` files go into an `Images` folder).
- Easy to use from the command line.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (make sure `cargo` is available)

### 🏗️ Build

Clone the repository and build the project:

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd file_organzer
cargo build --release
```

### ▶️ Usage

Run the program with the target directory as an argument:

```sh
cargo run -- <target_directory>
```

Or, after building, use the binary:

```sh
./target/release/file_organzer <target_directory>
```

**Example:**

```sh
cargo run -- ~/Downloads
```

This will organize files in your `Downloads` folder into subfolders by type.

### ℹ️ Notes

- 📝 The program will print messages for each file it moves.
- 🔒 Make sure you have write permissions for the target directory.
